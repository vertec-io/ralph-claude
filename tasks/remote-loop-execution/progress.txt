# Ralph Progress Log
Effort: remote-loop-execution
Type: Bug Investigation (Feasibility Study)
Started: 2026-01-23
Rotation: 1 (rotated at 2026-01-23 13:54)

## Codebase Patterns
- DUAL-MODE agent management: tmux for claude, opencode serve for opencode
- Claude: Sessions run in detached tmux sessions via libtmux (session.py)
- Claude: Tmux sessions use `remain-on-exit`, `tmux_session_alive()` checks `pane_dead_status`
- Claude: Attach is `tmux attach-session -t <name>`, stop uses signal files
- OpenCode: `opencode serve --port <auto>` starts headless HTTP server
- OpenCode: TUI via `opencode attach http://localhost:<port>` — native opencode experience
- OpenCode: Prompts sent via `POST /session/:id/message` (sync) or `prompt_async` (async)
- OpenCode: Completion detected via SSE events (`GET /event`) — `session.idle` event
- OpenCode: Stop via `POST /session/:id/abort`, health via `GET /global/health`
- OpenCode: Server stores sessions in `~/.opencode/data/storage/` (filesystem, not SQLite)
- OpenCode: Multiple clients can connect simultaneously (SSE broadcast)
- OpenCode: `OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD` enables HTTP Basic Auth
- OpenCode server mode: OpencodeServer class in opencode_server.py manages lifecycle
- OpenCode server mode: Port range 14096-14196 for auto-assignment
- OpenCode server mode: Loop sends sync prompts (POST /session/:id/message blocks until done)
- OpenCode server mode: Process group created with os.setsid for clean shutdown
- Session state tracked in SQLite at `~/.local/share/ralph/sessions.db`
- Sessions table has session_type (tmux|opencode-server) and server_port columns
- CLI routes agent=opencode to opencode-server mode, agent=claude to tmux mode
- CLI uses Click, session management uses libtmux (not subprocess tmux calls)
- Progress file rotation preserves Codebase Patterns section across rotations
- For remote opencode: Ziti proxies the HTTP port, `opencode attach http://<ziti>:<port>` works
- For remote claude: proxy tmux socket over Ziti or SSH-over-Ziti tunnel
- OpenZiti Python SDK (v1.5.0): no native asyncio, but Ziti fds are epoll-compatible on Linux
- SDK supports multiple service binds per process from one ZitiContext
- Identity loaded via openziti.load(path) returning ZitiContext; one context can host N services

## 2026-01-23 16:30 - US-004
- Implemented opencode server mode for local loops
- Created new module: `src/ralph_uv/opencode_server.py` (~480 lines)
  - `OpencodeServer` class: manages `opencode serve` subprocess lifecycle
  - Port auto-assignment (range 14096-14196), health checking, HTTP API client
  - `create_session()`, `send_prompt()`, `wait_for_idle()` (SSE), `abort_session()`
  - Proper process group management (SIGTERM → SIGKILL with timeout)
- Modified `src/ralph_uv/cli.py`:
  - When agent=opencode, routes to `_spawn_opencode_server()` instead of tmux
  - Starts server, waits for health, registers in SQLite, runs loop in-process
- Modified `src/ralph_uv/loop.py`:
  - `LoopRunner` accepts `opencode_server` parameter
  - `_run_agent_via_server()`: creates sessions and sends sync prompts via HTTP
- Modified `src/ralph_uv/attach.py`:
  - Dispatches to `opencode attach http://localhost:<port>` for opencode-server sessions
  - Falls back to tmux attach for tmux sessions
- Modified `src/ralph_uv/session.py`:
  - Added `session_type` and `server_port` columns with migration support
  - `opencode_server_alive()` health check function
  - `stop_session()` kills server process for opencode-server sessions
  - `cleanup_session()` handles both session types
  - `list_running()` and `get_status()` validate per session type
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `opencode serve --port 0` lets OS assign a port, but the assigned port isn't printed to stdout — we find free ports ourselves
  - `POST /session/:id/message` is synchronous (blocks until agent responds) — perfect for loop iteration model
  - The `opencode attach <url>` command provides the native TUI over HTTP — no terminal proxying needed
  - `preexec_fn=os.setsid` creates a process group, allowing clean SIGTERM to all children
  - SQLite schema migration uses PRAGMA table_info to detect missing columns
  - mypy strict mode requires explicit bool() for comparison expressions in returns
