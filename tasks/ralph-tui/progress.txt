# Ralph Progress Log
Effort: ralph-tui
Type: Feature

## 2026-01-17 - US-001
- Implemented: Split ralph.sh into non-interactive and legacy interactive versions
- Files changed:
  - ralph.sh - removed all tmux/interactive code (~300 lines removed)
  - ralph-i.sh - new file containing interactive tmux functionality
  - tasks/ralph-tui/prd.json - marked US-001 as passes: true
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - ralph.sh is now a clean non-interactive loop (simpler foundation for ralph-tui)
  - ralph-i.sh is the legacy interactive mode using tmux
  - Both scripts share the same core functionality (task selection, progress rotation, iteration loop)
  - The split allows ralph-tui to eventually replace ralph-i.sh as the primary interactive mode
